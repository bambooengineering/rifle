# Rifle

Rifle is a search engine backed by [Redis](www.redis.io). It is designed to be very simple and very fast.
Unlike other similar projects, it can operate not only in a simple single application mode, but also in a
distributed architecture without one single monolithic Rails application or redis instance.

# Deprecated

It was a fun project while it lasted, but this project is deprecated. 
ElasticSearch does everything rifle does and so much more... Use that instead.
